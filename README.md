### My AI Usage

During the development of this project, I leveraged AI tools to improve workflow efficiency and maintain best practices:

### Tools Used:

#### ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5) 
: Assisted in generating structured README content, suggesting TDD Git commit workflows, and explaining complex concepts clearly.

#### Claude AI
: Helped generate boilerplate code for routes, controllers, and React components.

### How I Used AI:

Generated detailed commit messages for Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

Suggested test cases for authentication, sweet management, and inventory modules.

Assisted in designing the frontend layout, including glassmorphism UI effects.

### Reflection:

AI helped save development time and reduce repetitive coding tasks.

It provided guidance for maintaining proper coding standards and consistent TDD practices.

All AI-generated code was reviewed and customized to match my application‚Äôs requirements.
